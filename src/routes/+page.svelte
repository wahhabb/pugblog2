  |  Hi! Want to learn more about Svelte and SvelteKit? So do I! 
  |  I’m Wahhab Baldwin, retired founder of Deep Web Works. 
  |  I’ve decided to repurpose my website to share tutorials based on my adventures with 
  |  Svelte and SvelteKit. I hope you’ll find it useful, and I welcome your 
  a(href="/contact") feedback
  | . 

h2  So What Are Svelte and SvelteKit?

  alt="Svelte Logo")
p.
  As you likely know, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> is a framework for building 
  user interfaces. JavaScript based,
  it is compared to React and Vue. Unlike these, however, it is a compiler, does not use a 
  shadow DOM, or link in a run-time library, making it small and fast. It is also much easier
  to learn. StackOverflow’s recent survey showed Svelte as the most-loved web framework.

p. 
  <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> is a framework for building web 
  applications that provides routing, client-side and/or server-side rendering, code-splitting, and more. 
  It is comparable to Next in React or Nuxt in Vue. It makes it quick and easy to 
  develop sites (like this one!) with a great developer experience.
  It replaces Sapper, an earlier tool. SvelteKit hasn’t yet issued a 1.0 release, although
  it is used in production in sites like nytimes.com. Still, I am convinced 
  that Svelte and SvelteKit will grow rapidly and become a major force in web development.
  In any event, it’s fun learning and using them!

h2 Let’s Dive In!

p. 
  To use these tutorials, you should be familiar with web development and JavaScript, and
  have <a href="https://nodejs.dev/download/">Node.js and npm</a> installed on your 
  computer to follow my code examples.
